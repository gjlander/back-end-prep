# Integrating AI Chatbot into the Travel Journal

### Getting more detailed with system instructions

- We've already seen how we can use system instruction to shape how our chatbot behaves. When we have a more specific use-case, these instructions will get much more sophisticated. Instead of a single line, we can have one or more paragraphs shaping the behaviour we want it to have
- This guide comes from Vertex AI, a wrapper you can use with Gemini API, so the way they use it is slightly different, but is directly applicable to how we want to update our system instruction: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/chat/chat-prompts#context

### Integrating with Travel Journal

- The next exercise is to take this chatbot that we've built in isolation, and integrate it into an actual project
- Go over instructions in README, start demoing moving the files over
- In the end, demo how end result should look
